## Email Extractor Project

This project is a simple web-based application that extracts email addresses from a block of text. <br>
It takes input from a textarea, processes the text to find email addresses, and outputs the unique email addresses in another textarea, each separated by a new line. <br> 
It also counts and displays the number of unique email addresses found.
