  <textarea name="txtarea" rows="12" cols="50">Hello there,
You can reach me at john.doe@example.com for any inquiries. Also, my colleague Jane's email is jane_smith123@company.org.
Let's not forget the support team at support@helpdesk.com or sales@business.com for any sales-related questions.
Random text here without any email address.
Another email you might need is info@website.net, which is very important.
Contact the admin at admin@domain.co.uk if you have any admin issues.
Here is a fake email: not_an_email@ just for testing purposes.
Some more text to ensure emails are not the only thing present.
One more: dev.team@dev.org for the development team.
And another one: feedback@service.io for sending feedback.
Lastly, here is a tricky one: "personal-email@personal-email.com".
Good luck with your project!
